# Project Guidelines

## Repository Shape

- Root `AGENTS.md` is the workspace-wide source of truth. Do not add
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Treat this repository as a template skeleton, not as a fully initialized app.
  Language-specific manifests, task-runner files, dependency metadata, and
  test configs may be introduced later by setup flows and are not guaranteed to
  exist yet.
- Keep this file short and durable. Put file-type and workflow-specific rules
  in `.agents/instructions/*.instructions.md`, reusable workflows in
  `.agents/prompts/*.prompt.md`, and skill assets in `.agents/skills/<skill>/`.
- `src/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/` currently exist as template directories and
  may contain only `.gitkeep` placeholders. Inspect the on-disk tree before you
  assume source files, tests, or runnable commands already exist.

## Architecture

- Agent customization is file-driven:
  - `opencode.json` registers `.agents/instructions/**/*.md` and
    `.agents/skills/`
  - `.opencode/commands/` mirrors prompt workflows for OpenCode consumers
  - `.vscode/settings.json` defines terminal auto-approve patterns and editor
    behavior
- Repository automation currently lives in:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI scaffolding
  - `.github/dependabot.yml` for dependency-update scope
  - `.commitlintrc.mjs` for commit message policy
- Formatting and newline behavior come from `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`,
  `.markdownlint.jsonc`, and `.agents/.markdownlint.jsonc`.

## Build and Test

- Verify the relevant manifests, scripts, workflow files, and local configs
  exist before you run or document toolchain commands.
- Detect install, build, test, lint, format, type-check, and release commands
  from actual repository files instead of assuming a default stack.
- For Rust workflows, treat `Cargo.toml`, `.cargo/config.toml`,
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and
  `.agents/instructions/rust-workflow.instructions.md` as source-of-truth
  inputs for validation commands and expectations.
- When a language, framework, task runner, or test system is clearly present,
  add or refine focused instruction files for it rather than stuffing detailed
  rules into `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep CI, editor automation, prompt examples, and instruction files aligned
  with the commands and configs that are actually present in the repository.

## Conventions

- Distinguish between what is present today and what is only part of the
  intended template contract. Do not describe absent files as if they already
  exist.
- Before writing stack-specific guidance, inspect concrete evidence such as
  manifests, lockfiles, source tree layout, scripts, CI workflows, editor
  settings, and dedicated config files.
- When you detect a real stack, add instructions for it carefully and
  thoroughly in a narrow, well-named instruction file whose `description` and
  `applyTo` target the relevant files.
- Prefer linking to canonical config files instead of copying large policy
  blocks into multiple customization files.
- Keep customization files narrowly scoped: repo-wide defaults in `AGENTS.md`,
  detailed file-specific guidance in `.agents/instructions/`.
- Preserve mirrored prompt content between `.agents/prompts/` and
  `.opencode/commands/` when both copies exist.
- Respect the repository newline policy: Markdown and shell scripts use LF;
  PowerShell and batch scripts use CRLF.
